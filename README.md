## Review process

We issued a [call for musicians](https://twitter.com/pcastr/status/1156212727792246788) at the end of July, out of which we received 29 applicants. We had 13 reviewers who helped us pick 15 performers. Once the performers were selected, Pablo and Mohamed sorted out the schedule for the evening (which we won't announce yet, to keep it as a surprise!).

In the end we ended up with a diverse set of performers and musical styles, which we can't wait to share with the rest of the NeurIPS community at the banquet!

We'd like to thank our volunteer reviewers, without whom this would not have been possible:

*  Ayman Shams
*  Byron Galbraith
*  Eliya Masesa
*  Israel Birhane
*  Jayson Salkey
*  Lauren Pfeifer
*  Manan Dey
*  Pablo Samuel Castro
*  Paola Cascante-Bonilla
*  Raesetje Sefala
*  Ritwik Gupta

Party on!
