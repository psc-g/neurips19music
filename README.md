Good kid is band of five programmers that met at the university of Toronto while studying computer science. They have played their brand of fast paced indie rock in New York, LA, and Toronto and are super excited to play NeuRIPS! During the daytime Nick Frosst (vocals) works at Google Brain where he focuses on adversarial examples and capsule networks. He has been trying to convince the other members to abandon their respective fields to get in on the deep learning hype, but so far he has only convinced Jon (drums).
